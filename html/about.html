      <h2>The story of BRUS</h2>
      <div class="grid_1-1">
        <p class="about_t">
          BRUS is a brewpub by To Øl brewery. BRUS is a brewery, bar, bottleshop
          and restaurant in Nørrebro, where To Øl originally started their
          brewing adventures. A so-called brewpub, where the brew travel less
          than 20 meter from tanks to glass offering the arguably most fresh
          brew on the bridge!

        In an old iron foundry and locomotive factory in Copenhagen, BRUS made
        the engines start running again. Brand new brewing facilities, specialty
        products, bar buzz and a kitchen team is breathing new life into the old
        warehouse; a 750m2 raw building with activities ranging from brewing,
        kegging, cooking, shopping, dining and drinking. It all comes together
        in a sum of quality, science, experiments and functionality to create a
        playful venue for beer-lovers, microbrewers and hungry souls who fancy
        some socializing city life.

          The Danish name ‘BRUS’ refers to the sparkling quality liquid obtains
          when carbonated; the frizzy feeling of great brew. With production
          on-location, BRUS aims to be Copenhagen’s most ambitious microbrew
          projects to date.

        Our mission is to create a lively location for beer geeks, tonic
        treasurers and food fans and to offer our guests a whole new experience
        of going to a brewpub. We want to bring the experimental approach from
        craft beer production on to a wider and wilder selection of micro-brewed
        beverages. We love testing new flavor compositions. We bring in the
        twining herb of hops to infuse our tonic, the aromatic scent of yuzu in
        our citrus fruit juice and fermentation techniques from craft beers on
        to a wider drink repertoire. You’re able to grab a quick bite before
        going to the cinema next door, but you can also stay seated for a full
        meal and when you recon it’s time to go home, slip by the shop for some
        bottle-shopping. You can get drunk in craft beers or die trying from all
        the frizzyness of our soft drink collection.
